# Stage overview

## Stage rythm

Each stage should have the following format:

- SceneryA
- midstage-boss
- SceneryB
- endstage-boss

So each "half-level" has different scenery, a bossfight and some unique
enemy types for that "half-level".

Enemies can be reused thoughout more halfs though, and scenery can also be reused. But each half the player should at least have a feeling of location progression, it would also be good that some enemy encounters actively use the scenery involved, giving it a place in the world where it would not fit elsewhere.

## Acts

After a set of levels, the next "Act" will start. The next act would be a bigger change of scenery, (leaving earth for space, leaving space for an enemy planet, etc). In these changes it would also be great that the player's craft is also progressing.
